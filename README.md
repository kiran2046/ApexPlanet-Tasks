2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Interact with the button to trigger the modal.

2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Fill out the contact form and submit.
4.  Add tasks to the To-Do list.

### Task 3: Fun Zone

1.  Navigate to the `Task-3` directory.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3.  Answer the quiz questions.
4.  Click the "Tell Me a Joke" button to fetch a random joke.

### Task 4: Multi-Page Application

*   **Portfolio:**
    1.  Navigate to the `Task-4/portfolio` directory.
    2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
    3.  Explore the different sections and interact with the contact form.
